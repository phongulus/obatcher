# Domainslibs Fork - Batching support

This fork introduces support for a technique called "batching" which aims to increase data structure throughput of programs. In programs that run with "batching" support, data structure operations can be processed as a logical "batch" instead of atomic operations which reduces synchronization overhead and opens up more opportunities for optimisation. The goal of this work is to provide the scheduling infrastructure for the community to innovate and build new data structures for OCaml that stand to benefit from batching.

The main contributions of our work include:
1. A portable Batcher which makes turning explicitly batched data structures to their implicitly batched versions cheap.
2. A Batcher that allows multiple batched data structures in the same program.
3. Two functors for turning sequential data structures following either a split-join or expose-repair pattern into implicitly batched ones.
4. Examples of batched data structures utilising the aforementioned functors, as well as ad-hoc batched data structures. 
5. Tools for investigating the performance of these batched data structures.

## Build instructions

Install dependencies:

```
opam switch create 5.1.1
eval $(opam env)
opam install dune lockfree qcheck-core qcheck-stm qcheck-multicoretests-util mirage-clock-unix ppx_deriving ppx_deriving_qcheck iter
opam install batteries progress ptime cmdliner datalog
```

Build:

```
dune build
```

## Running tests and benchmarks

<!-- Provided tests can be simply run after building with:

```
dune runtest
``` -->

For benchmarking, navigate to the `benchmarks/` directory and use `make` commands:

```
cd benchmarks
make avltree-batched
```

The result of the benchmarks will be printed in `stdout`. See the Makefile therefor the full list of benchmarks that can be run this way.

A more advisable way to run the benchmarks would be to use the provided Jupyter Notebook in `benchmarks/paper-bench.ipynb`. To use it, grab the latest release of Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/).

Otherwise, if you wish, you set up a Python virtual environment and run the Jupyter Notebook that way:

```
cd benchmarks
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!-- Note: For the jupyter notebook, you will need `ipympl` installed.

The batch_limit is configured by adjusing the chunk_size of `parallel_for` which determines the number of tasks grouped together to run asynchronously. A chunk_size of 1 corresponds to 1_000_000 operations spawned.

For standard parallel counters (LockCounter & LockfreeCounter), performance degrades as the number of cores increase. BatchedCounters on the other hand scale better, plateuing around 7 cores.

- BatchedCounter: Disjoint BOP operation, sequential chokepoint to create the "batch"
- BatchedCounterF: No sequential chokepoint from generating the "batch", integrated BOP
- BatchedCounterFF: Use fast and slow path

Turns out, there is a non-obvious "best" batch_limit.

My testing shows that a batch limit of 4096 operations per batch yields the best throughput for this batched counter. However, this "optimal" batch limit is highly dependent on performance of the batched operations as well as the workload of the core program.

### (SEQ) always performs better in both traditional synchronization and batching
1. Traditional synchronization - Overhead due to contention for shared resource dominates parallelism benefits
2. Batching - Overhead of batching dominates the speedup of batching

### (SEQ) performance difference between sections
The large difference in (SEQ) performance between the two sections are due to the number of tasks spawned. In the previous section, 1_000_000 tasks are spawned, causing contention in the scheduling. In the current section, the number of tasks spawned is greatly reduced, at most being 4096 tasks.

### Batching performance analysis
Like the earlier section, Batched counters from 2 -> 8 domains demonstrate mostly steady speedup and then some plateuing towards the end (Some slowdown is also observed). Batched counters are a unique case because the cost of increment or decrement operations are so cheap that the benefits of batching are hard to see. The below experiments are to show how `parallel_prefix_sums` which is the underlying batch operation without implicit batching shows marginal speedup after 5 domains. We also show how inserting delays to exaggerate the performance gain of batching reveals consistent speedup.

## Design
In the original design proposed by the authors, support for implicit batching had to be integrated into the runtime scheduler. In OCaml however, schedulers are written as modular library components that wrap programs. This is convenient since it makes the scheduler portable and now we don't need to dive into the internals of the runtime to change them. Furthermore, our design cleanly partitions the batching logic from the scheduler by only using `promise` and `await` API's exposed by the scheduler. This organization makes the Batcher itself modular and also interestingly solves the problem of not being able to have multiple batched data structures in the same program.

We implement a functor that encapsulates implicit batching support. Using this functor which takes an explicitly batched data structure as input, it generates a implicitly batched version of that data structure.
![batcher design](./BatcherComparison.png)
## Notes
There is an interesting trade-off between the number of parallel operations running and the cost of parallelising tasks. It seems like creating huge batches, tests with batches as big as 15,000 does not beat tests with batches of size 60. This trade-off seems to be measured in the chunk_size calculation of the parallel-for algorithm. However, it does not always seem to be the best choice especially because it is dependent on how fast the batched operations run vs the sequential operations. I also suspect that if we can avoid the sequential bottle neck when we pass around the operation array, we may be able to attain more consistent behaviour

# Domainslib - Nested-parallel programming

Domainslib provides support for nested-parallel programming. Domainslib provides async/await mechanism for spawning parallel tasks and awaiting their results. On top of this mechanism, domainslib provides parallel iteration functions. At its core, domainslib has an efficient implementation of work-stealing queue in order to efficiently share tasks with other domains.

Here is a _sequential_ program that computes nth Fibonacci number using recursion:

```ocaml
(* fib.ml *)
let n = try int_of_string Sys.argv.(1) with _ -> 1

let rec fib n = if n < 2 then 1 else fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)

let main () =
  let r = fib n in
  Printf.printf "fib(%d) = %d\n%!" n r

let _ = main ()
```

We can parallelise this program using Domainslib:

```ocaml
(* fib_par.ml *)
let num_domains = try int_of_string Sys.argv.(1) with _ -> 1
let n = try int_of_string Sys.argv.(2) with _ -> 1

(* Sequential Fibonacci *)
let rec fib n =
  if n < 2 then 1 else fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)

module T = Domainslib.Task

let rec fib_par pool n =
  if n > 20 then begin
    let a = T.async pool (fun _ -> fib_par pool (n-1)) in
    let b = T.async pool (fun _ -> fib_par pool (n-2)) in
    T.await pool a + T.await pool b
  end else
    (* Call sequential Fibonacci if the available work is small *)
    fib n

let main () =
  let pool = T.setup_pool ~num_domains:(num_domains - 1) () in
  let res = T.run pool (fun _ -> fib_par pool n) in
  T.teardown_pool pool;
  Printf.printf "fib(%d) = %d\n" n res

let _ = main ()
```

The parallel program scales nicely compared to the sequential version. The results presented below were obtained on a 2.3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 MacBook Pro with 4 cores and 8 hardware threads.
